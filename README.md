# AvifaunaBonesClassification
Codes for the classification of photographs of skeletal findings of avifauna. In the Typology code, a Convolutional Neural Network is implemented for the classification of the skeletal element. In the Species code, a Convolutional Neural Network with Random Forest is implemented for bird species classification.
